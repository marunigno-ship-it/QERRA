Core ethical decision engine for the QAI Project.  
Quantum Ethical Resource Allocator – trained on real moral dilemmas (including the €28.000 extraction case).

Quantum state vectors in `/vectors/` drive W-state entanglement → provably fair resource distribution for humanoid robots on Earth and Mars.
