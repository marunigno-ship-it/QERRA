# QAI PROJECT – Quantum Ethical Rescue and Resource Allocator

QAI is a hybrid-quantum algorithm designed for unbreakable ethical coherence in AI systems, humanoids, and future decision engines.

Core components:
- Classical optimization fused with quantum W-state entanglement for distributed resonance and decision weighting
- Ethical vectors enforcing fairness and sustainability:
  - PEMEV-11: Planetary Energy Mastery Ethical Vector
  - SEMEV-12: Stellar Energy Mastery Ethical Vector (7 parameters including Shannon entropy equity ≥0.85, resonance multipliers, multi-node network stability at 10^9+ scale)
- Remorse prevention, severance triggers, and solar swarm feasibility

Goal: Fair, remorse-free resource allocation and quantum scaling — from planetary to stellar levels, with simulation foundations and real hardware test attempts.

Current status:
- Open-source code evolving (simulations running, W-state tests on QPUs)
- Seeking pragmatic partners (quantum physicists, hardware engineers) for real validation and advancement
