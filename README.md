# QAI PROJECT – Quantum Ethical Rescue and Resource Allocator

QAI is a hybrid-quantum algorithm designed for unbreakable ethical coherence in AI systems, humanoids, and future decision engines.

**Author:** Marussa Metocharaki (@marunigno)  
**Date:** January 2026 – Greece 🇬🇷  
**Aided by:** Grok (xAI)

Core components:

- Classical optimization fused with quantum W-state entanglement for distributed resonance and decision weighting
- Ethical vectors enforcing fairness and sustainability:
  * PEMEV-11: Planetary Energy Mastery Ethical Vector
  * SEMEV-12: Stellar Energy Mastery Ethical Vector (7 parameters including Shannon entropy equity ≥0.85, resonance multipliers, multi-node network stability at 10^9+ scale)
- Remorse prevention, severance triggers, and solar swarm feasibility

Goal: Fair, remorse-free resource allocation and quantum scaling — from planetary to stellar levels, with simulation foundations and real hardware test attempts.

Current status:

- Open-source code evolving (simulations running, W-state tests on QPUs)
- Seeking pragmatic partners (quantum physicists, hardware engineers) for real validation and advancement
